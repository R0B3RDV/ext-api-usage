Plesk has an extensive XML API protocol that was designed to support interaction between Plesk and third-party software remotely. Using this XML API protocol, Plesk extensions can ask Plesk to perform various tasks.

This extension shows how to perform API calls to Plesk XML-RPC interface in scope of an extension. Specifically, the following actions are demonstrated:

* Creation of a client via XML-RPC.
* Creation of a subscription via XML-RPC.
* Creation of a form and its further processing.
